# Movie-Database-System

## Abstract 
The goal of this project is to create a movie database system that is connected with a frontend user interface which enables a user to keep a track of all his movies, their ratings, any favorite stars associated with the movie. The user has the ability to manage the database by inserting new movie, star name, rating or even manage existing data by editing the data content, or even deleting the data content.
The frontend is made using basic HTML, and connected with the database schema by means of PHP. The database schema has been created using Postgresql and hosted on the university pgsql service. The initialization script has been attached with the project source code and a further file of the queries used for creating has been attached in order to prevent further changes to the database.
The project contains multiple dummy data which includes dummy movies, dummy people related with the movie, and even dummy ratings which can be fetched, edited or even deleted as per the will of the user. Our focus is on the functioning of the important components of the project so thereby no login credentials have to be provided to access the database from the php page. The project can be run straight from the script.
